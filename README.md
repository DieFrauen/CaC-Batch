HOW TO USE

In order to register these cards in your YGOPro build, you should extract the contents in this Zip file into your Expansions folder, the pictures and scripts for each card go in their respective folders along with all other files from different expansions. Make sure to check your repositories and everything else is in order. To play cards in Expansion files online with friends, you must use the LAN + AI mode, as these contents are not available in Server based duels.
